In this challenge, we will try a new method -in which we identify value stocks depending on how well-priced the stock currently is with respect to its future fundamentals. Our task is to create a ML  model that predicts a company's Operating Income and Revenue, based on the previous 10 years of quarterly fundamental data. You will be given data on a selection of stocks and you have to create two models that can predict any company's Operating Income and Revenue 12 months into the future.
